## About WebbyPHP
---
WebbyPHP is a lightweight, modular, “lego-style” PHP framework designed to make building APIs, CLI/Console tools, and Web Applications simple, modern, and enjoyable—especially for beginners.

Built as an enhanced extension of CodeIgniter 3, WebbyPHP brings a fresh, modern developer experience (DX) while keeping the simplicity, speed, and small footprint that made CI3 popular. It also introduces flexible modular architecture, improved routing, and integration patterns that make it easy to combine packages or even borrow concepts from other PHP frameworks.

Build powerful PHP applications with a simple, sweet, and scalable architecture.
